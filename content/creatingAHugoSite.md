Today I learned how to create a blog using Hugo and **it was easy**. Here are the simple steps I used:

1. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/)
2. Confirm hugo is installed by running `hugo env` in your terminal.
3. Learn how to use Hugo by accessing the help menu.

    Examples: `hugo --help`, `hugo new -h`, `hugo new site -h`, etc
4. Reading the help menu, we now know how to create a new site: `hugo new site <site-name>`
5. I grabbed a minimalistic theme from [here](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lugo) and followed install directions
6. Create some content using the new command `hugo new creatingAHugoSite.md`
7. That's it! Type away!

Oh, and don't forget to run `hugo server` so you can see the site live in your browser.
